# The why

## Why - (belief, dream, purpose, cause, mission)

### Why should anyone care? Why do you do it?

The will to live life differently comes in strage places and times. Perhaps it's motivation to make our town better, perhaps it's to help the environment. Perhaps its a desire to save money.

People want to do things but they don't know what to do. We hope to create a common language that lets everyone come together and build a better future.

Be Healthy with a high quality of life. Start a revolution. Imagine life without traffic. Low cost of transportation. Don't need permission or lots of money. Can do it now. People are ready and respond to the story of positive actions they can take. They know in there bones they can take personal responsibility and invest in the future. Kindness to each other and the environment.

Cars are expensive to buy, run, maintain, insure and store. They require huge amounts of infrastructure and space. They consume copious amounts of resources and emit deadly toxic gases. Cars are murder weapons.

I believe for people to bike more they need easier access to occasional car use and public transit.

I believe that a difference can be made with small steps each of us can make.

I believe that everyone has the will to make a positive difference. Some part of everyone is looking for a way to leave a positive impact.

It takes more energy to heat a big house than a small house. How do we survive the winter? Protection from the elements! Our houses and cars have heaters. So do our bodies! Make a small house around your body.

People drive to the gym for aerobic workouts! We can tap into transportation budget, health and wellness budget, clothing budget. Nutrition and food.

Don't worry so much about the bike. Bike commuting is a choice and you can bike on just about anything! Realize your dream of independent travel!

I want 3 stores and then I want 10 stores and then I want 20.

We aren't selling bikes. We are selling intelligent transportation that makes a difference. Bikes that take you places. Bikes that you can take places. Bikes for real life. Bikes for normal people. Focused on people that use bikes to get things done. We are living, breathing bike advocates.
