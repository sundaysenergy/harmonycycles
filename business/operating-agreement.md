## Article I - Members’ Meetings

Place of Meeting.  The meetings of the members shall be held at the registered office of the Company or at any other place designated by the Board of Managers or consented to in writing by all of the members entitled to vote at such meeting.

Annual Meeting.  The annual meeting of members shall be held at such time and place as is fixed by the Board of Managers, which date shall not be more than ninety days after the close of the fiscal year.

Special Meetings.  Special meetings of the members may be called at any time upon request of the chair of the Board, if any, the Chief Manager, any Vice President, the Treasurer, or two or more members of the Board of Managers, or upon request in writing to the chair of the Board, if any, the Chief Manager, any Vice President, or the Board of Managers by one or more members holding not less than one-tenth of the voting power of all membership interests of the Company entitled to vote.

Notice of Meeting.  Written notice stating the place, day and hour of the meeting, and in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called, shall be mailed or personally delivered not less than ten days nor more than sixty days prior to the date of the meeting, by the Secretary, to each member of record entitled to vote at such meeting.  Waiver by a member of notice of a members’ meeting, signed by the member, whether before or after the time of such meeting, or attendance at such meeting, shall be equivalent to the giving of such notice.  In case of adjournment of a meeting from time to time, no further notice of the adjourned meeting shall be necessary if an announcement is made at the meeting where the adjournment is had, specifying the place, day and hour of the adjourned meeting.

Voting Rights.  Members shall be entitled to vote on all matters in proportion to their voting interest.  Except as otherwise required by law, an owner of a membership interest entitled to vote may vote the membership interest in any way the member chooses.  If a member votes without designating the proportion of the membership interest in a particular way, the member will be deemed to have voted the entire membership interest in that way.

Proxies.  A member may cast or authorize the casting of a vote by filing a written appointment of a proxy with a manager of the Company at or before the meeting at which the appointment is to be effective.  The member may sign or authorize the written appointment by telegram, cablegram, facsimile or other means of electronic transmission setting forth or submitted with information sufficient to determine that the member authorized such transmission.  Any copy, facsimile, telecommunication or other reproduction of the original of either the writing or transmission may be used in lieu of the original, provided that it is a complete and legible reproduction of the entire original.

Quorum.  The presence, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the membership interests entitled to vote at the meeting shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business.  In the absence of a quorum any meeting may be adjourned from time to time.  The members present at a duly called or held meeting may continue to do business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of members owning membership interests which results less than a quorum being present at the meeting.

## Article II - Board of Managers

Number of Managers.  The business of the Company shall be managed by a Board of Managers who shall be named in the first minutes and shall thereafter be duly elected by the members.  The number of members of the Board of Managers shall be no less than one nor more than nine as determined by the members.  Members of the Board of Managers need not be members.  Decisions of the Board shall be by a majority of the managers present.

Tenure.  At each annual meeting the members shall elect managers to hold office for one year or until their successors are elected and have qualified.

Vacancies.  Any vacancy occurring in the Board of Managers may be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining managers or by election at a meeting of members.  A manager elected to fill a vacancy shall be elected for the unexpired term of his or her predecessor in office.

Meetings of the Board; Notice.  The Board of Managers shall meet each year immediately after the annual meeting of members, at the same place.  No notice of any kind to either old or new managers shall be necessary for such annual meeting or for any regular meeting of the managers fixed from time to time by resolution of a majority of the Board of Managers.  Other meetings of the Board of Managers may be held upon three days’ written notice upon the call of the Chief Manager or any two managers.  Notice may be waived in writing before or after the time of such meeting, and attendance of a manager at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice thereof.  Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose, of any meeting need be specified in the notice of such meeting.

Quorum.  A majority of the managers shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business; provided, however, that if any vacancies exist for any reason, the remaining managers shall constitute a quorum for the filling of such vacancies.
